I"İ<p>â€œI am looking for friends. What does that mean â€“ tame?â€</p>

<p>â€œIt is an act too often neglected,â€ said the fox. â€œIt means to establish ties.â€</p>

<p>â€œTo establish ties?â€</p>

<p>â€œJust that,â€ said the fox. â€œTo me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the worldâ€¦.â€</p>

<p>â€œPeople have forgotten this truth,â€ the fox said. â€œBut you mustnâ€™t forget it. You become responsible forever for what youâ€™ve tamed. Youâ€™re responsible for your rose.â€</p>

<p>â€œGrown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to themâ€</p>
