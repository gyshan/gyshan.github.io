I"ê<p>Well, it is my first time to write annual self-appraisal on my blog. Here is what I have got and what I am going to do.</p>

<h2 id="work">Work</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I have contributed three projects to Novogene: MSI algorithm, TMB algorithm, and ACMG auto-interpretation pipeline.</li>
  <li>The first half year is for MSI and TMB, and the latter half year is for IVD project.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="coding">Coding</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Wrote a project exceeding 3000-line codes, which enables me to handle relatively complex system.</li>
  <li>Finished reconstructing several of my old projects using python.</li>
  <li>Learned basic grammar of <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="life">Life</h2>

<ul>
  <li>My wife bought me a MacBook Pro 13-Inch(2017), which I used to write this article. It is necessary to have the proper tools to do good work.</li>
  <li>My cooking skill improves a lot, especially Stir-fried Shredded Pork with Green Pepper.</li>
  <li>Have read six books, which enlightened me most is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stories_about_Ming_Dynasty"><em>Stories about Ming Dynasty</em></a>.</li>
  <li>Got my master diploma from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Military_Medical_Sciences">AMMS</a>.</li>
  <li>Exercise once per week.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="2018">2018</h2>

<p>In 2018, I still hold the opinion that scientific writing and coding are the most critical skills for a bioinformatician. Therefore, my flags for 2018 are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reconstruct <em>one</em> of my projects using Scala</li>
  <li>Finish <em>a</em> machine learning project on Kaggle</li>
  <li>Study English <em>30</em> minutes per day</li>
  <li>Read <em>10</em> books</li>
  <li>Exercise <em>three</em> times per week, which is twice than what I have done in 2017</li>
  <li>Spare average <em>2</em> hours per day on the family</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Embrace 2018!</strong></p>
