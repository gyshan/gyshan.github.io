I"Ö<p>Yesterday, a friend of mine asked me if there was an excellent way to organize folders for a bioinformatics project. That is also an excellent question to me. As for me, when dealing with a relatively light-weight project such as testing a script for GC content counting or performing pure BLAST, I would prefer to use a flat folder.</p>

<p>However, when developing a relatively heavy-weight product such as an algorithm, like microsatellite instability determination or an auto-interpretation algorithm for NGS variants under ACMG guidelines, a flat folder structure is not well enough to support a project like this.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is necessary to organize the project folder seriously. The basic idea for organizing the folder is to guarantee the traceability and clarity. So, I strongly recommend the structure below:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">.
â”œâ”€â”€ 00.raw
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ raw_fasta.fa
â”œâ”€â”€ 01.bin
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ process.py
â”œâ”€â”€ 02.ref
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 20160211_report.pptx
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ material.pdf
â”œâ”€â”€ 03.rst
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ publication.png
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ svm.xlsx
â”œâ”€â”€ Misc
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ MWE
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ demo_input
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ work.sh
â””â”€â”€ ReadMe</code></pre></figure>

<p>The project folder includes five subfolders, which are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">raw</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rst</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Misc</code>. Besides, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ReadMe</code> file should contain in the project folder. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ReadMe</code> file is a form of documentation that contains information about other files in this directory. Each subfolder has its function in this project.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">raw</code>: Save raw files, often come from Illumina machine or website</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin</code>: Save developed scripts</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref</code>: Save reference materials</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rst</code>: Save important results</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Misc</code>: Save Miscellaneous files. The most critical subfolder in it is a minimal working example (MWE), which is a collection of source code and other essential data files, allowing a bug or problem to be demonstrated and reproduced.</li>
</ul>

<p>In a word, a well-organized folder can facilitate human readability and therefore be good for the project. The code is more for computers, and a well-organized folder structure is for humans. It is often more challenging to deal with humans than machines.</p>
