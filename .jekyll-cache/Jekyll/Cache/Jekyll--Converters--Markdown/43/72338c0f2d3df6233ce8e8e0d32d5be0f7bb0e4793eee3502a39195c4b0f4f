I"Û<p>In our daily life, we inevitably need to report to others, maybe your boss or a client, even your wife. Reporting is not such a type of work that grabs what you have and throws it to the receiver. To be honest, 70% reports I received are coming to me in this way, and it is very rude. Here, I want to present some practical skills to present a ‚Äúnot-too-rude‚Äù report. Even though the report described here will be restricted to sending information to others, not giving a presentation, I think they share the same core value: respect.</p>

<p>I have been not only reported to my boss but also got reported by my subordinates. According to what I have received, I insist that a good report should follow a ‚Äúprinciple of altruism‚Äù. In other words, imagine you are the report-receiver, what exactly do you want?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Send it through Email, not any IM (Instant Message) software.</li>
  <li>Write a precise and concrete title.</li>
  <li>Give your conclusion first.</li>
  <li>Extract solid evidence to support the conclusion.</li>
  <li>Make the evidence traceable.</li>
</ol>

<p>In fact, I agree that the project manager can trade between the constraints of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle">project management triangle</a>. If the deadline/budget decreases, we can sacrifice our product quality to some extent to complete our task. But if there is an opportunity to improve the task, including delivering a better report, we should keep it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The quality of work is constrained by the project‚Äôs budget, deadlines and scope (features).</p>

<p>Delivering a report resembles serving cakes. Somebody throws them at your desk, regardless of whether you have proper tools to eat them. Somebody slices them up and put the slices in a dish. The better way is to slice them up as well as to tell the gourmet what is the chef recommendation and why it is the best choice.</p>

<p>Everyone is busy, hope we can think more before we send our report.</p>
