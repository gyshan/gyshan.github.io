<p>“I am looking for friends. What does that mean – tame?”</p>

<p>“It is an act too often neglected,” said the fox. “It means to establish ties.”</p>

<p>“To establish ties?”</p>

<p>“Just that,” said the fox. “To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world….”</p>

<p>“People have forgotten this truth,” the fox said. “But you mustn’t forget it. You become responsible forever for what you’ve tamed. You’re responsible for your rose.”</p>
