I"8<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indel">InDel</a> is a common concept in molecular biology, while the representation for InDels are non-unique. There are at least two representations: left-alignment and right-alignment. Actually, it does not really matter, but it good to have a convention. I would like to suggest using left-alignment for these reasons:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ref            : CGTATGATCTA [GCGCGC] TAGCTAGCTAGC
left-alignment : CGTATGATCTA [--GCGC] TAGCTAGCTAGC
right-alignment: CGTATGATCTA [GCGC--] TAGCTAGCTAGC</code></pre></figure>

  <li>
    <p>Standard
Statistical genetics center of the university of Michigan denotes that <a href="https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Variant_Normalization#Left_alignment">left-alignment</a> is necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Community
Most famous tools are stick to left-alignment, such as <a href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/3.8-0/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_indels_LeftAlignIndels.php">GATK</a>, <a href="http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/articles/VCF/">ANNOVAR</a> and related databases:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The standard convention is to place an indel at the left-most position possible.   —GATK</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since left-normalization is gaining more and more popularity, my suggestion is to just use left-normalization, and that database curators as well as users both use this practice, so that we can compare apples to apples.   —ANNOVAR</p>

<p>In the end, I would prefer to stick to the convention — <strong>left-alignment</strong>.</p>
