I've been studied bioinformatics for more than 3 years, but still not a bioinformatician yet. 

To be a bioinformatician is my dream since I stepped into this mystery world. In my opinion, there are two basic skills for a mature bioinformatician: **coding** and **scientific writing**.

Coding holds a crucial role in bioinformatics. The amount of Biological data is expanding. Steady coding ability will facilitate your experience when dealing with multi-omics data and biomedical text data. When dealing with text data, python is a good choice to parse text, analyze segment and yield information. While when you need some statistics or visualization, R is impassable. The whole task is processed under *nix operating system. When an algorithm is fully developed, you should deploy it as a software to let others use. This is a tough step, because build a user-friendly software is not an easy thing. So, with all these consideration, coding can never be too vital to a bioinformatician.

In addition, scientific writing is just as important as coding, which I haven't noticed for a very long time. As a bioinformatician, or to-be bioinformatician, speak out of your idea in a proper way is essential for the whole career. Put forward a problem you want to investigate. Tell the reader why you want to do this (Introduction), explain how you do that (Method) and what did you get (Result). Finally, a concrete discussion can make your manuscript complete. At last, polish the manuscript to a real paper. Please bear in mind that Method and Result cannot be dispersed with each other. In this part, logical chain is the backbone to all subject. The best paper is written with a proper logical chain and specific evidence. To me, logical chain first. Unfold logical node from logical chain is a skillful method, which needs to be put into my whole life into it.

At the end of this small piece of text, I know where I want to go, do you?
