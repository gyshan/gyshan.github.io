In our daily life, we inevitably need to report to others, maybe your boss or a client, even your wife. Reporting is not such a type of work that just grabs what you have and through it to the receiver. To be honest, 70% reports I received is coming to me in this way and it is very rude. Here, I want to present some practical skills to present a 'not-too-rude' report. Even though the report described here will be restricted to sending information to others, not giving a presentation, but I think they share the same core value: respect.

I have been not only reported to my boss but also got reported by my subordinates. From what I received, I insist that a good report should follow a “principle of altruism”. In other words, imagine you are the report-receiver, what do you want.

1. Send it through Email, not any IM software. 
2. Write a precise and concrete title. 
3. Give your conclusion first. 
4. Extract solid evidence to support the conclusion.
5. Have the evidence traceable.

In fact, I agree that the project manager can trade between the constraints of [project management triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle). If deadline/budget decrease, we can sacrifice our quality to some extent to complete our task. But if we have any opportunity to improve the task, including delivering a better report, we should do it.

> The quality of work is constrained by the project's budget, deadlines and scope (features).

Delivering a report is like serving cakes. Somebody just throws at your desk, regardless of if you have proper tools to eat them. Somebody will slice them up and put the slices in a dish. The better way is not only to slice them up but tells the gourmet what is the chef recommendation and why it is the best choice.

Everyone is busy, hope we can think more before we send our report.
