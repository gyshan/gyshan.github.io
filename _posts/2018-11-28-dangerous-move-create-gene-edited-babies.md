Since [CRISPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) technology has come into the world, the community began to worry about the [mako sharks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_Sea_(1999_film)) will jump out of the science fiction into the real world someday. It is not a very difficult experiment, and many labs have experimental conditions and talents to perform it. No one kicks the door is because of the hidden ethics problems until three days ago. 

As first reported by Antonio Regalado at MIT Technology Review. The Chinese scientist Jiankui He reported the birth of two human girls, [Lulu and Nana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lulu_and_Nana), as the world’s first CRISPR-edited babies. The Human genes were edited to resist the HIV. This technology move brings great [ethical discussion](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/27/he-jiankui-chinese-gene-edited-baby-claims-scientists-shocked-global-outcry) in the world. 

To what I have learned, this experiment is of dangerous, and we have no idea what has been created to the world. Our body is full of protein, which has been coded by 3.2 billion bases. The base and permutation determined human phenotype, like hair color, weight, and height, etc. Let me explain gene editing with a computer programming project. There is no one in the world can fully comprehend the 3.2 billion codebase line by line. At the same time, our human achieved code base (Human genome sequence), and code editor (CRISPR), someone (Jiankui He) begun to delete two lines of code and initiate the program (give birth of two babies). 

Even in the programming environment, programmers cannot easily modify code without fully comprehend the code base because bugs are always waiting for us somewhere. Modify before understand will bring the unknown risk for a project, even for human beings.

Therefore, maybe we need to suspend this kind of experiments until we collect enough information for human genome comprehension.
